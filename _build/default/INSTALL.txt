Now, configure it with the following steps:
a. Extract everything into a new folder "pulseaudio-1.1"
b. Go to "pulseaudio-1.1/etc/pulse/default.pa". In that default.pa file,
find the line "#load-module module-native-protocol-tcp". Replace this
entire line with "load-module module-native-protocol-tcp auth-ip-acl=127.0.0.1"
(make sure there is no "#" after this change). Also, find the line
"load-module module-waveout sink_name=output source_name=input" and add
"record=0" at the end of it.
c. Go to "pulseaudio-1.1/etc/pulse/daemon.conf". In that daemond.conf file,
find the line "; exit-idle-time = 20" and replace it with "exit-idle-time = -1"
